# Next.js Developer-Themed Personal Website Template

This is a custom personal website theme built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It's designed as a minimal,
performance-focused starting point for showcasing your **work**, **blogs**, and **projects**.

<summary><b>📝 Author's Note About This Theme</b></summary>

This theme is generally aimed at developers and designers who want to create a personal website quickly and easily. Yes,
I'm aware there are many other templates and themes available..._you can literally find them all over the internet_. The
personal goal of building this theme was to get familiar with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), and improve skills in
**React** and **TypeScript**.

I also wanted to create a starter template for myself, since none of the existing templates met my exact design and
functionality needs, without requiring extensive modifications. So...here we are! Feel free to use this as a starting
point for your own personal website, or as a reference for doing the same thing I did: _building your own custom theme!_

## 💎 Key Features

- Main dashboard (Home page), with `/work`, `/projects`, and `/blog` links
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) support for blog posts, projects, and work items
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/)-validated frontmatter for all MDX content types. Invalid files are caught at build time with
  precise field-level error messages
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks in MDX files
- Light/dark mode toggle. The classic theme switcher ;)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- SEO-friendly structure and metadata,
  including [JSON-LD structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data)
  on the home page and blog posts for Google rich results eligibility. For more context, also see
  Vercel's [JSON-LD guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/json-ld)
- Automatic `sitemap.xml` that discovers every blog post, project, work item, and tag page at build time. No
  manual updates needed when content is added or removed! (See `src/app/sitemap.ts` for implementation details)
- SSR support for pagination, sorting, and filtering of blog posts, projects, and work items
- Similar blog posts recommendations
- Blog post categories pages
- [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) route automatically generated from content metadata to help agents/crawlers discover
  your content
- RSS.xml feed automatically generated from the blog posts available on the site
- [Dynamic Open Graph image generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/metadata-and-og-images#generated-open-graph-images)
  for the home page, `/blog`, `/projects`, `/work`, and all their individual posts, items, and tag pages
- Easy customization through a centralized configuration file (`src/data/metadata.ts` and `src/data/content.ts`) for all
  site content and appearance settings

---

## 🧱 Project Structure

The site is organized around the following main routes/pages:

- 🏠 **Home** – `/`
- 💼 **Work** – `/work`
- 🛠️ **Projects** – `/projects`
- ✍️ **Blog** – `/blog`

Each page is intentionally _simple_ and _clean_, making it easy to customize and build upon.

### ✨ Minimal Configuration Required

This theme is designed with **simplicity** in mind. After customizing your home page, adding content is as easy as
creating `.mdx` files:

- **Blog Posts**: Drop a new `.mdx` file in `src/data/blog/` with frontmatter (title, summary, date, tags)
- **Work Items**: Add an `.mdx` file in `src/data/work/` with your work details
- **Projects**: Create an `.mdx` file in `src/data/projects/` with project information

That's it! No manual configuration files to update, no arrays to maintain. The site automatically discovers and renders
your content. Just write your content in Markdown, add frontmatter metadata, and the theme handles the rest: generating
pages, navigation, filtering, and search capabilities automatically.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start your development environment locally, after cloning the repository, run the following command
in the root directory of the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or via `bum` (recommended):

```bash
bum run dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the
homepage. Running this command starts the app in development mode with hot-reloading enabled, so any changes you make to
the code will automatically reflect in the browser without needing to restart the server.

You can also build the project for production using:

```bash
npm run build
```

or via `bum`:

```bash
bum run build
```

And then start the production server with:

```bash
npm start
```

or via `bum`:

```bash
bum run start
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

This template is designed for easy customization! All content and configuration is centralized in the `src/data/`
folder. Here's how to make it yours:

### 1. Update Site Metadata (`src/data/metadata.ts`)

Edit `src/data/metadata.ts` to customize your site's SEO and social media information:

- **theme**: Choose an accent color for the site (e.g., `blue`, `green`, `purple`, `amber`, etc.)
- **title**: Your site/portfolio title
- **description**: A brief description of your portfolio
- **keywords**: Array of relevant keywords for SEO
- **author**: Your name and website URL
- **siteUrl**: Your actual domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`)
- **social.twitter**: Your Twitter/X handle (e.g., `@yourhandle`)
- **ogImage**: (Optional) Path to a custom home page OG image in your `public/` folder (e.g. `"/og-image.png"`). Set to
  `null` to use the auto-generated dynamic image instead

### 2. Update Personal Information (`src/data/content.ts`)

Edit `src/data/content.ts` to customize your homepage and footer:

**Homepage Intro:**

- `name`: Your name (displayed in the heading)
- `introParagraphs`: Array of introduction paragraphs about yourself
- `facts`: Your current company, education, location, languages, and role
- `additionalFacts`: Custom facts with icons (hobbies, interests, etc.)

**Footer:**

- `copyrightName`: Your name for the copyright notice
- `socialLinks`: Your social media URLs (just add the URLs, icons are automatic!)
    - Supported platforms: GitHub, LinkedIn, Goodreads, Instagram, Twitter/X, Reddit, Dribbble, YouTube, Bluesky, Stack
      Overflow, Email
    - Leave any field empty (`""`) to hide that social link
- `showVersionAndAttribution`: Set to `false` to hide the template attribution (true by default). Leaving the
  attribution is appreciated but not required!

### 3. Add Your Content (`.mdx` files)

Create `.mdx` files in the respective folders to add your content:

- **Blog Posts**: `src/data/blog/your-post.mdx`
- **Projects**: `src/data/projects/your-project.mdx`
- **Work Experience**: `src/data/work/your-job.mdx`

Each `.mdx` file should include frontmatter with metadata (title, date, tags, etc.). The site automatically discovers
and renders all content from these files!

### 4. Update Visual Assets

- **Favicon**: Replace `/public/icons/favicon.ico` with your own icon
- **OG Image** (optional): Place a 1200×630 px image in `/public/` and set `ogImage` in `src/data/metadata.ts` to its
  path to use a custom home page preview. Set `ogImage` to `null` to use the auto-generated image instead

That's it! 🎉 The template automatically uses your configuration and content throughout the site. No need to modify
components or understand the codebase!

## 🔍 SEO

This template ships with a comprehensive SEO setup out of the box: global metadata, Open Graph and Twitter Card tags,
dynamic OG image generation, JSON-LD structured data, a sitemap, a `robots.txt`, an RSS feed, and an `llms.txt` route.

### Dynamic Open Graph images

Per-page Open Graph images are generated at build time using Next.js's built-in `ImageResponse` API. When someone shares
a link on social media or a messaging app, they get a branded preview image instead of a blank card.

| Blog post                                       | Work item                                       | Project                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Blog OG example](public/og-examples/blog.png) | ![Work OG example](public/og-examples/work.png) | ![Project OG example](public/og-examples/project.png) |

| Blog tag                                      | |
|-----------------------------------------------|-|
| ![Tag OG example](public/og-examples/tag.png) | |

| Route              | Image content                                                                             |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/`                | Auto-generated (name, role, company, location) — or your custom image if `ogImage` is set |
| `/blog`            | "All Posts" heading, total post count, and 3 most recent post titles                      |
| `/projects`        | "All Projects" heading, total project count, and up to 4 project names                    |
| `/work`            | "Work Experience" heading, total company count, and up to 4 companies with their role     |
| `/blog/[slug]`     | Post title, summary, tags, and date                                                       |
| `/blog/tag/[tag]`  | Tag name, post count, and latest 3 post titles                                            |
| `/work/[slug]`     | Company name, role, description, period, and locations                                    |
| `/projects/[slug]` | Project title, description, tech stack, and duration                                      |

The home page generates a dynamic OG image by default. To use a custom static image instead, set `siteMetadata.ogImage`
in `src/data/metadata.ts` to its path in the `public/` folder (e.g. `"/og-image.png"`); set it to `null` to go back to
the generated image. All generated images pick up the accent color from `siteMetadata.theme` — changing the theme
updates the color across the entire site _and_ in all OG images automatically.

Images are generated at **build time** and cached. With the dev server running, you can preview any of them directly:

```
http://localhost:3000/opengraph-image
http://localhost:3000/blog/opengraph-image
http://localhost:3000/projects/opengraph-image
http://localhost:3000/work/opengraph-image
http://localhost:3000/blog/your-post-slug/opengraph-image
http://localhost:3000/blog/tag/typescript/opengraph-image
http://localhost:3000/work/your-company-slug/opengraph-image
http://localhost:3000/projects/your-project-slug/opengraph-image
```
